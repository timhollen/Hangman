My version of hangman with random as the only imported module

My thoughts on the project

The code

The code for this project is good not great. The structure and how the code works are great. But the variable names and comments and lacking. I am pleased with the low amout of variables and the compact efficient code. I am displeased with my varible names and lack of comments. I am also proud of the solution and the codes inneer workings. 

What i learned for the project
 
I got confident that i can write compact good code. This program is small and is just an indictor that i can be done. One goal for my next project is that my structure remains equaly as good and that my variable names can get better.
